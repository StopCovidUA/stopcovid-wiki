**Remote work advice**

**1. If you've been commuting, keep a percentage of your commute cost for "nice things" at work - whether that's a great lamp for your desk, an image you love in a frame, some plants or a set of 20 Sharpies in different colours. Put the rest of the money into your savings if you don’t need to use it for other essential costs.**  


**2. The presenters on Radio 5 Live \(or your station of choice\) are a big part of your life but they are not actually your real friends. Talk to some real people each day as well as the radio/the cat/the dog.**  


**3. Routine! Get up, wash your face, stretch. Be sure to set times around to stretch, do a little exercise, drink water, eat nourishing foods, and when to turn all the tech off. “I am only working from 8-4, an hour for lunch, and 4 mini-breaks for stretching and water.”**
